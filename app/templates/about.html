      <h1>About the App</h1>
      <p>This app is a text summarizer that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextRank">TextRank algorithm</a> to summarize text. It is a simple extractive summarization technique that is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank algorithm</a> used by Google Search.</p>
      <p>It works by first splitting the text into sentences and then splitting the sentences into words. It then computes a score for every word in the text. The score for a word is calculated by adding up the scores of the words that co-occur with it in the text. The score for a sentence is calculated by adding up the scores of the words that make up the sentence. The summary is then generated by including the sentences with the highest scores.</p>
